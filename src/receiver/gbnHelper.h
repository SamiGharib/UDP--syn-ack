 * @param sfd : it's the socket file descirptor into witch we are gonna receive the data from the sender.
 * @return pkt_status_code : it return PKT_OK if everting whent correctly or the apropriate error code

 * The goal of this function is to manage the packet that has juste been receive by the network
